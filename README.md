This is a rewrite of the original WallDestroyer made by Tellurium for Idle Game Maker.

The rewrite is made for Idle Game Maker v2 while adding no extra content (yet?). I am currently committing small balance changes.

Feel free to test it at http://orteil.dashnet.org/igm/?g=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YSKNM/walldestroyer/refs/heads/main/walldestroyer.txt and report any issues or even contribute fixes as Pull Requests on this repository.

Full credits for the idea and content go to Tellurium, I myself only adapted it to the v2 of IGM, and Qjuh for adapting it to IGM v2.
